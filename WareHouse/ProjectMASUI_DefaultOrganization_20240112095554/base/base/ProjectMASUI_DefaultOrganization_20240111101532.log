[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev, designed for local desktop environment. The application should:
1. Set up a Django/Flask environment on the local desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries.
2. Clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories into a specific directory, maintaining distinct structures for each system.
3. Develop RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, including data parsing and error management.
4. Create a module for managing local open-source LLMs, with initialization, loading, and unloading functionalities.
5. Implement modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration, including authentication and document upload/download capabilities.
6. Develop a React-based UI for local desktop usage, with distinct sections for MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling. Include a data library UI with tabs for code, tables, and figures, and support for local and cloud storage.
7. Implement a feedback mechanism with a UI form, directing feedback to an 'improvement table' and converting feedback into structured prompts for ChatDev.
8. Integrate a metrics system for monitoring application and MAS performance, and develop an interactive dashboard.
9. Ensure robust security protocols including HTTPS, encryption, and secure cloud authentication, and comply with GDPR.
10. Create detailed test plans for all components, emphasizing testing in a local desktop environment.
11. Provide comprehensive documentation and a user support framework.
12. Prepare a local deployment guide and a maintenance plan with regular updates and optimizations.
Include Human-Agent-Interaction mode for interactive code review and modification based on user inputs..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev, designed for local desktop environment. The application should:
1. Set up a Django/Flask environment on the local desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries.
2. Clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories into a specific directory, maintaining distinct structures for each system.
3. Develop RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, including data parsing and error management.
4. Create a module for managing local open-source LLMs, with initialization, loading, and unloading functionalities.
5. Implement modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration, including authentication and document upload/download capabilities.
6. Develop a React-based UI for local desktop usage, with distinct sections for MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling. Include a data library UI with tabs for code, tables, and figures, and support for local and cloud storage.
7. Implement a feedback mechanism with a UI form, directing feedback to an 'improvement table' and converting feedback into structured prompts for ChatDev.
8. Integrate a metrics system for monitoring application and MAS performance, and develop an interactive dashboard.
9. Ensure robust security protocols including HTTPS, encryption, and secure cloud authentication, and comply with GDPR.
10. Create detailed test plans for all components, emphasizing testing in a local desktop environment.
11. Provide comprehensive documentation and a user support framework.
12. Prepare a local deployment guide and a maintenance plan with regular updates and optimizations.
Include Human-Agent-Interaction mode for interactive code review and modification based on user inputs..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev, designed for local desktop environment. The application should:
1. Set up a Django/Flask environment on the local desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries.
2. Clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories into a specific directory, maintaining distinct structures for each system.
3. Develop RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, including data parsing and error management.
4. Create a module for managing local open-source LLMs, with initialization, loading, and unloading functionalities.
5. Implement modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration, including authentication and document upload/download capabilities.
6. Develop a React-based UI for local desktop usage, with distinct sections for MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling. Include a data library UI with tabs for code, tables, and figures, and support for local and cloud storage.
7. Implement a feedback mechanism with a UI form, directing feedback to an 'improvement table' and converting feedback into structured prompts for ChatDev.
8. Integrate a metrics system for monitoring application and MAS performance, and develop an interactive dashboard.
9. Ensure robust security protocols including HTTPS, encryption, and secure cloud authentication, and comply with GDPR.
10. Create detailed test plans for all components, emphasizing testing in a local desktop environment.
11. Provide comprehensive documentation and a user support framework.
12. Prepare a local deployment guide and a maintenance plan with regular updates and optimizations.
Include Human-Agent-Interaction mode for interactive code review and modification based on user inputs..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev, designed for local desktop environment. The application should:
1. Set up a Django/Flask environment on the local desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries.
2. Clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories into a specific directory, maintaining distinct structures for each system.
3. Develop RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, including data parsing and error management.
4. Create a module for managing local open-source LLMs, with initialization, loading, and unloading functionalities.
5. Implement modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration, including authentication and document upload/download capabilities.
6. Develop a React-based UI for local desktop usage, with distinct sections for MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling. Include a data library UI with tabs for code, tables, and figures, and support for local and cloud storage.
7. Implement a feedback mechanism with a UI form, directing feedback to an 'improvement table' and converting feedback into structured prompts for ChatDev.
8. Integrate a metrics system for monitoring application and MAS performance, and develop an interactive dashboard.
9. Ensure robust security protocols including HTTPS, encryption, and secure cloud authentication, and comply with GDPR.
10. Create detailed test plans for all components, emphasizing testing in a local desktop environment.
11. Provide comprehensive documentation and a user support framework.
12. Prepare a local deployment guide and a maintenance plan with regular updates and optimizations.
Include Human-Agent-Interaction mode for interactive code review and modification based on user inputs..

In our software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the deployment_guide.py file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the deployment_guide.py and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev, designed for local desktop environment. The application should:
1. Set up a Django/Flask environment on the local desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries.
2. Clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories into a specific directory, maintaining distinct structures for each system.
3. Develop RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, including data parsing and error management.
4. Create a module for managing local open-source LLMs, with initialization, loading, and unloading functionalities.
5. Implement modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration, including authentication and document upload/download capabilities.
6. Develop a React-based UI for local desktop usage, with distinct sections for MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling. Include a data library UI with tabs for code, tables, and figures, and support for local and cloud storage.
7. Implement a feedback mechanism with a UI form, directing feedback to an 'improvement table' and converting feedback into structured prompts for ChatDev.
8. Integrate a metrics system for monitoring application and MAS performance, and develop an interactive dashboard.
9. Ensure robust security protocols including HTTPS, encryption, and secure cloud authentication, and comply with GDPR.
10. Create detailed test plans for all components, emphasizing testing in a local desktop environment.
11. Provide comprehensive documentation and a user support framework.
12. Prepare a local deployment guide and a maintenance plan with regular updates and optimizations.
Include Human-Agent-Interaction mode for interactive code review and modification based on user inputs..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

1. Set up a Django/Flask environment on the local desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries.
2. Clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories into a specific directory, maintaining distinct structures for each system.
3. Develop RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, including data parsing and error management.
4. Create a module for managing local open-source LLMs, with initialization, loading, and unloading functionalities.
5. Implement modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration, including authentication and document upload/download capabilities.
6. Develop a React-based UI for local desktop usage, with distinct sections for MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling. Include a data library UI with tabs for code, tables, and figures, and support for local and cloud storage.
7. Implement a feedback mechanism with a UI form, directing feedback to an 'improvement table' and converting feedback into structured prompts for ChatDev.
8. Integrate a metrics system for monitoring application and MAS performance, and develop an interactive dashboard.
9. Ensure robust security protocols including HTTPS, encryption, and secure cloud authentication, and comply with GDPR.
10. Create detailed test plans for all components, emphasizing testing in a local desktop environment.
11. Provide comprehensive documentation and a user support framework.
12. Prepare a local deployment guide and a maintenance plan with regular updates and optimizations.
Include Human-Agent-Interaction mode for interactive code review and modification based on user inputs..

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Develop a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev, designed for local desktop environment. The application should:
1. Set up a Django/Flask environment on the local desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries.
2. Clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories into a specific directory, maintaining distinct structures for each system.
3. Develop RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, including data parsing and error management.
4. Create a module for managing local open-source LLMs, with initialization, loading, and unloading functionalities.
5. Implement modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration, including authentication and document upload/download capabilities.

8. Integrate a metrics system for monitoring application and MAS performance, and develop an interactive dashboard.
9. Ensure robust security protocols including HTTPS, encryption, and secure cloud authentication, and comply with GDPR.
10. Create detailed test plans for all components, emphasizing testing in a local desktop environment.
11. Provide comprehensive documentation and a user support framework.
12. Prepare a local deployment guide and a maintenance plan with regular updates and optimizations.
Include Human-Agent-Interaction mode for interactive code review and modification based on user inputs..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is regarding the implementation of the `handle_mas_interaction`, `handle_llm_management`, and `handle_document_handling` methods in the `ReactUI` class. These methods are currently empty and need to be implemented to handle the respective functionalities.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this, you need to add the necessary logic inside each of these methods to handle MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling. You can refer to the task requirements to understand the expected functionality and implement the logic accordingly.

For example, in the `handle_mas_interaction` method, you can add code to interact with the AutoGen and ChatDev APIs by making appropriate API calls and processing the responses. Similarly, in the `handle_llm_management` method, you can add code to initialize, load, and unload the local open-source LLMs. And in the `handle_document_handling` method, you can add code to handle document upload and download functionalities for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration.

Make sure to update the method signatures and return types as required, and add necessary error handling and data parsing logic.

Once you have implemented these methods, the ReactUI class will be able to handle MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling as per the task requirements.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

For example, in the `handle_mas_interaction` method, you can add code to interact with the AutoGen and ChatDev APIs by making appropriate API calls and processing the responses. Similarly, in the `handle_llm_management` method, you can add code to initialize, load, and unload the local open-source LLMs. And in the `handle_document_handling` method, you can add code to handle document upload and download functionalities for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration.

Make sure to update the method signatures and return types as required, and add necessary error handling and data parsing logic.

Once you have implemented these methods, the ReactUI class will be able to handle MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling as per the task requirements.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

You can refer to the task requirements to understand the expected functionality and implement the logic accordingly.\n\nFor example, in thehandle_mas_interactionmethod, you can add code to interact with the AutoGen and ChatDev APIs by making appropriate API calls and processing the responses. Similarly, in thehandle_llm_managementmethod, you can add code to initialize, load, and unload the local open-source LLMs. And in thehandle_document_handling` method, you can add code to handle document upload and download functionalities for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration.\n\nMake sure to update the method signatures and return types as required, and add necessary error handling and data parsing logic.\n\nOnce you have implemented these methods, the ReactUI class will be able to handle MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling as per the task requirements.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance.'} |

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is regarding the implementation of the `handle_mas_interaction`, `handle_llm_management`, and `handle_document_handling` methods in the `ReactUI` class. These methods are currently empty and need to be implemented to handle the respective functionalities.

<SUGGESTION>
To fix this, you need to add the necessary logic inside each of these methods to handle MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling. You can refer to the task requirements to understand the expected functionality and implement the logic accordingly.

For example, in the `handle_mas_interaction` method, you can add code to interact with the AutoGen and ChatDev APIs by making appropriate API calls and processing the responses. Similarly, in the `handle_llm_management` method, you can add code to initialize, load, and unload the local open-source LLMs. And in the `handle_document_handling` method, you can add code to handle document upload and download functionalities for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration.

Make sure to update the method signatures and return types as required, and add necessary error handling and data parsing logic.

Once you have implemented these methods, the ReactUI class will be able to handle MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling as per the task requirements.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance."

Similarly, in the handle_llm_management method, you can add code to initialize, load, and unload the local open-source LLMs. And in the handle_document_handling method, you can add code to handle document upload and download functionalities for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration.\n\nMake sure to update the method signatures and return types as required, and add necessary error handling and data parsing logic.\n\nOnce you have implemented these methods, the ReactUI class will be able to handle MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling as per the task requirements.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further assistance.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the `handle_mas_interaction` method in the `ReactUI` class. Currently, the method directly creates instances of the `AutoGenAPI` and `ChatDevAPI` classes within the method. This violates the principle of separation of concerns and makes the code less modular and reusable.

<Suggestion>
To address this, I suggest refactoring the code to follow the dependency injection principle. Instead of creating instances of the `AutoGenAPI` and `ChatDevAPI` classes within the `handle_mas_interaction` method, we can pass them as arguments to the method. This way, the method becomes more flexible and can work with different implementations of the `AutoGenAPI` and `ChatDevAPI` classes.

Here's an updated version of the `handle_mas_interaction` method:

```python
def handle_mas_interaction(self, autogen_api, chatdev_api):
    # Implement MAS interaction logic here
    autogen_data = {'action': 'generate'}
    autogen_result = autogen_api.process_request(autogen_data)
    chatdev_data = {'action': 'chat'}
    chatdev_result = chatdev_api.process_request(chatdev_data)
    return autogen_result, chatdev_result
```

By making this change, we decouple the `ReactUI` class from the specific implementations of the `AutoGenAPI` and `ChatDevAPI` classes, making it easier to test and maintain the code.

Please make the necessary modifications to the `ReactUI` class and update the code accordingly.

Currently, the method directly creates instances of the AutoGenAPI and ChatDevAPI classes within the method.

Instead of creating instances of the AutoGenAPI and ChatDevAPI classes within the handle_mas_interaction method, we can pass them as arguments to the method. This way, the method becomes more flexible and can work with different implementations of the AutoGenAPI and ChatDevAPI classes.\n\nHere's an updated version of the handle_mas_interaction method:\n\npython\ndef handle_mas_interaction(self, autogen_api, chatdev_api):\n    # Implement MAS interaction logic here\n    autogen_data = {'action': 'generate'}\n    autogen_result = autogen_api.process_request(autogen_data)\n    chatdev_data = {'action': 'chat'}\n    chatdev_result = chatdev_api.process_request(chatdev_data)\n    return autogen_result, chatdev_result\n\n\nBy making this change, we decouple the ReactUI class from the specific implementations of the AutoGenAPI and ChatDevAPI classes, making it easier to test and maintain the code.\n\nPlease make the necessary modifications to the ReactUI class and update the code accordingly."} |

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the implementation of the `handle_mas_interaction` method in the `ReactUI` class. Currently, the method directly creates instances of the `AutoGenAPI` and `ChatDevAPI` classes within the method. This violates the principle of separation of concerns and makes the code less modular and reusable.

<Suggestion>
To address this, I suggest refactoring the code to follow the dependency injection principle. Instead of creating instances of the `AutoGenAPI` and `ChatDevAPI` classes within the `handle_mas_interaction` method, we can pass them as arguments to the method. This way, the method becomes more flexible and can work with different implementations of the `AutoGenAPI` and `ChatDevAPI` classes.

Here's an updated version of the `handle_mas_interaction` method:

```python
def handle_mas_interaction(self, autogen_api, chatdev_api):
    # Implement MAS interaction logic here
    autogen_data = {'action': 'generate'}
    autogen_result = autogen_api.process_request(autogen_data)
    chatdev_data = {'action': 'chat'}
    chatdev_result = chatdev_api.process_request(chatdev_data)
    return autogen_result, chatdev_result
```

By making this change, we decouple the `ReactUI` class from the specific implementations of the `AutoGenAPI` and `ChatDevAPI` classes, making it easier to test and maintain the code.

Please make the necessary modifications to the `ReactUI` class and update the code accordingly."

You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Develop a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev, designed for local desktop environment. The application should:
1. Set up a Django/Flask environment on the local desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries.
2. Clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories into a specific directory, maintaining distinct structures for each system.
3. Develop RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, including data parsing and error management.
4. Create a module for managing local open-source LLMs, with initialization, loading, and unloading functionalities.
5. Implement modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration, including authentication and document upload/download capabilities.
6. Develop a React-based UI for local desktop usage, with distinct sections for MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling. Include a data library UI with tabs for code, tables, and figures, and support for local and cloud storage.
7. Implement a feedback mechanism with a UI form, directing feedback to an 'improvement table' and converting feedback into structured prompts for ChatDev.
8. Integrate a metrics system for monitoring application and MAS performance, and develop an interactive dashboard.
9. Ensure robust security protocols including HTTPS, encryption, and secure cloud authentication, and comply with GDPR.
10. Create detailed test plans for all components, emphasizing testing in a local desktop environment.
11. Provide comprehensive documentation and a user support framework.
12. Prepare a local deployment guide and a maintenance plan with regular updates and optimizations.
Include Human-Agent-Interaction mode for interactive code review and modification based on user inputs..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Quick Install pip install langchain or conda install langchain -c conda-forge 🤔 What is this? Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge. This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)

- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)
