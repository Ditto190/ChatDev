        ## Introduction
        This is the documentation for the web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev.
        ## Installation
        To install and run the application, follow these steps:
        1. Install Python:
           - Download and install Python from the official website.
        2. Set up a virtual environment:
           - Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
           - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
             python -m venv venv
           - Activate the virtual environment:
             - For Windows:
               venv\Scripts\activate
             - For macOS/Linux:
               source venv/bin/activate
        3. Install dependencies:
           - Run the following command to install the required libraries:
             pip install -r requirements.txt
        4. Clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories:
           - Run the following commands to clone the repositories:
             git clone https://github.com/autogen/autogen.git
             git clone https://github.com/chatdev/chatdev.git
        5. Set up AutoGen:
           - Follow the instructions in the AutoGen repository to set up the MAS system.
        6. Set up ChatDev:

        # Test Plan for {component}
        ## Description
        This test plan covers the testing of the {component} component of the web-based Python application.
        ## Test Cases
        ### Test Case 1: {component} initialization
        - Description: Test the initialization of the {component} component.
        - Steps:
          1. Perform the initialization of the {component}.
          2. Verify that the {component} is initialized correctly.
        - Expected Result: The {component} should be initialized without any errors.
        ### Test Case 2: {component} functionality
        - Description: Test the functionality of the {component}.
        - Steps:
          1. Perform the required actions to test the functionality of the {component}.
          2. Verify that the {component} functions as expected.
        - Expected Result: The {component} should perform its intended functionality without any errors.
