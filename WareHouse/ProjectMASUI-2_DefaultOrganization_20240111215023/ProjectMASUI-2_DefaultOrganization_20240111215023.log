**task_prompt**: Begin the development of 'ProjectMASUI', a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev. Start with these foundational steps: 1. Initial Setup and Integration: - Set up a local Django/Flask environment on the desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries. - Integrate AutoGen and ChatDev by cloning their repositories into a structured directory. If already cloned, add functionality to select the existing directories. 2. Backend Development: - Start developing RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, focusing on sending requests and receiving responses, along with initial data parsing and error management. - Begin creating a local open-source LLM management module with basic functions for initializing and loading models. 3. Frontend Development (Initial Phase): - Lay the groundwork for a React-based UI, tailored for local desktop usage. Include placeholder sections for MAS interactions and LLM management. 4. Foundational Cloud Storage Integration: - Implement initial modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive, focusing on basic authentication and setup. This phase should establish the core backend and frontend structure, preparing the application for further development of advanced features and components.

Task description: "".

Modality: "web application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Initial Setup and Integration: - Set up a local Django/Flask environment on the desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries. - Integrate AutoGen and ChatDev by cloning their repositories into a structured directory. If already cloned, add functionality to select the existing directories. 2. Backend Development: - Start developing RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, focusing on sending requests and receiving responses, along with initial data parsing and error management. - Begin creating a local open-source LLM management module with basic functions for initializing and loading models. 3. Frontend Development (Initial Phase): - Lay the groundwork for a React-based UI, tailored for local desktop usage. Include placeholder sections for MAS interactions and LLM management. 4. Foundational Cloud Storage Integration: - Implement initial modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive, focusing on basic authentication and setup.

If already cloned, add functionality to select the existing directories. 2. Backend Development: - Start developing RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, focusing on sending requests and receiving responses, along with initial data parsing and error management. - Begin creating a local open-source LLM management module with basic functions for initializing and loading models. 3. Frontend Development (Initial Phase): - Lay the groundwork for a React-based UI, tailored for local desktop usage. Include placeholder sections for MAS interactions and LLM management. 4. Foundational Cloud Storage Integration: - Implement initial modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive, focusing on basic authentication and setup.

Unimplemented File:
"cloud_storage.py"
In our software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the cloud_storage.py file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the cloud_storage.py and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Begin the development of 'ProjectMASUI', a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev. Start with these foundational steps: 1. Initial Setup and Integration: - Set up a local Django/Flask environment on the desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries. - Integrate AutoGen and ChatDev by cloning their repositories into a structured directory. If already cloned, add functionality to select the existing directories. 2. Backend Development: - Start developing RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, focusing on sending requests and receiving responses, along with initial data parsing and error management. - Begin creating a local open-source LLM management module with basic functions for initializing and loading models. 3. Frontend Development (Initial Phase): - Lay the groundwork for a React-based UI, tailored for local desktop usage. Include placeholder sections for MAS interactions and LLM management. 4. Foundational Cloud Storage Integration: - Implement initial modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive, focusing on basic authentication and setup. This phase should establish the core backend and frontend structure, preparing the application for further development of advanced features and components..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Begin the development of 'ProjectMASUI', a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev. Start with these foundational steps: 1. Initial Setup and Integration: - Set up a local Django/Flask environment on the desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries. - Integrate AutoGen and ChatDev by cloning their repositories into a structured directory. If already cloned, add functionality to select the existing directories. 2. Backend Development: - Start developing RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, focusing on sending requests and receiving responses, along with initial data parsing and error management. - Begin creating a local open-source LLM management module with basic functions for initializing and loading models. 3. Frontend Development (Initial Phase): - Lay the groundwork for a React-based UI, tailored for local desktop usage. Include placeholder sections for MAS interactions and LLM management. 4. Foundational Cloud Storage Integration: - Implement initial modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive, focusing on basic authentication and setup. This phase should establish the core backend and frontend structure, preparing the application for further development of advanced features and components..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

In our software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the complete function of our developed software, you have to implement all methods in the cloud_storage.py file which contains a unimplemented class. Now, implement all methods of the cloud_storage.py and all other codes needed, then output the fully implemented codes, strictly following the required format.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Begin the development of 'ProjectMASUI', a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev. Start with these foundational steps: 1. Initial Setup and Integration: - Set up a local Django/Flask environment on the desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries. - Integrate AutoGen and ChatDev by cloning their repositories into a structured directory. If already cloned, add functionality to select the existing directories. 2. Backend Development: - Start developing RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, focusing on sending requests and receiving responses, along with initial data parsing and error management. - Begin creating a local open-source LLM management module with basic functions for initializing and loading models. 3. Frontend Development (Initial Phase): - Lay the groundwork for a React-based UI, tailored for local desktop usage. Include placeholder sections for MAS interactions and LLM management. 4. Foundational Cloud Storage Integration: - Implement initial modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive, focusing on basic authentication and setup. This phase should establish the core backend and frontend structure, preparing the application for further development of advanced features and components..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is related to the missing imports in the code. The following classes are referenced but not imported in the respective modules:

- In `main.py`, the `AutoGenAPI` and `ChatDevAPI` classes from `backend` module are referenced but not imported.
- In `frontend.py`, the `React` class from the `react` module is referenced but not imported.
- In `cloud_storage.py`, the `GoogleCloudStorage` and `OneDriveStorage` classes are referenced but not imported.

To fix this, you need to add the necessary import statements at the beginning of each module. Here are the suggested revisions:

In `main.py`, add the following import statements:
```python
from backend import AutoGenAPI, ChatDevAPI
```

In `frontend.py`, add the following import statement:
```python
import React from 'react';
```

In `cloud_storage.py`, add the following import statements:
```python
from google.cloud import storage
from onedrive import OneDrive
```

Please make these revisions to ensure that all referenced classes are properly imported.

Initial Setup and Integration: - Set up a local Django/Flask environment on the desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries. - Integrate AutoGen and ChatDev by cloning their repositories into a structured directory. If already cloned, add functionality to select the existing directories. 2. Backend Development: - Start developing RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, focusing on sending requests and receiving responses, along with initial data parsing and error management. - Begin creating a local open-source LLM management module with basic functions for initializing and loading models. 3. Frontend Development (Initial Phase): - Lay the groundwork for a React-based UI, tailored for local desktop usage. Include placeholder sections for MAS interactions and LLM management. 4. Foundational Cloud Storage Integration: - Implement initial modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive, focusing on basic authentication and setup. This phase should establish the core backend and frontend structure, preparing the application for further development of advanced features and components..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Begin the development of 'ProjectMASUI', a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev. Start with these foundational steps: 1. Initial Setup and Integration: - Set up a local Django/Flask environment on the desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries. - Integrate AutoGen and ChatDev by cloning their repositories into a structured directory. If already cloned, add functionality to select the existing directories. 2. Backend Development: - Start developing RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, focusing on sending requests and receiving responses, along with initial data parsing and error management. - Begin creating a local open-source LLM management module with basic functions for initializing and loading models. 3. Frontend Development (Initial Phase): - Lay the groundwork for a React-based UI, tailored for local desktop usage. Include placeholder sections for MAS interactions and LLM management. 4. Foundational Cloud Storage Integration: - Implement initial modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive, focusing on basic authentication and setup. This phase should establish the core backend and frontend structure, preparing the application for further development of advanced features and components..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is regarding the missing imports in the code. Several modules are referenced but not imported, which will result in NameError when running the code. The missing imports are as follows:

In main.py:
- from backend import AutoGenAPI, ChatDevAPI

In cloud_storage.py:
- from google.cloud import storage
- from onedrive import OneDrive

Please add these imports to the respective files to resolve the NameError.

<Suggestion>
In main.py, add the following imports at the top of the file:
```python
from backend import AutoGenAPI, ChatDevAPI
```

In cloud_storage.py, add the following imports at the top of the file:
```python
from google.cloud import storage
from onedrive import OneDrive
```

Once the imports are added, the NameError will be resolved.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is regarding the missing imports in the code. Several modules are referenced but not imported, which will result in NameError when running the code. The missing imports are as follows:

In main.py:
- from backend import AutoGenAPI, ChatDevAPI

In cloud_storage.py:
- from google.cloud import storage
- from onedrive import OneDrive

Please add these imports to the respective files to resolve the NameError.

<Suggestion>
In main.py, add the following imports at the top of the file:
```python
from backend import AutoGenAPI, ChatDevAPI
```

In cloud_storage.py, add the following imports at the top of the file:
```python
from google.cloud import storage
from onedrive import OneDrive
```

Once the imports are added, the NameError will be resolved."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:

CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

Comments on Codes:
The highest priority comment is regarding the missing imports in the code. Several modules are referenced but not imported, which will result in NameError when running the code. The missing imports are as follows:

In main.py:
- from backend import AutoGenAPI, ChatDevAPI

In cloud_storage.py:
- from google.cloud import storage
- from onedrive import OneDrive

Please add these imports to the respective files to resolve the NameError.

In main.py, add the following imports at the top of the file:
```python
from backend import AutoGenAPI, ChatDevAPI
```

In cloud_storage.py, add the following imports at the top of the file:
```python
from google.cloud import storage
from onedrive import OneDrive
```

Once the imports are added, the NameError will be resolved.

To specify the dependencies or packages required for the ProjectMASUI web application to run properly, you can create a requirements.txt file. Based on the provided codes and modules, the requirements.txt file should include the necessary Python packages and versions. Here's an example of a requirements.txt file for the ProjectMASUI application:

requirements.txt

```
Django==3.2.8
Flask==2.0.2
google-cloud-storage==1.42.0
onedrivesdk==2.3.1
```

In this example, we include Django and Flask for the web framework, google-cloud-storage for Google Cloud integration, and onedrivesdk for OneDrive integration. Make sure to specify the appropriate versions based on your project's requirements.

You can add more packages to the requirements.txt file if you have additional dependencies in your project. Each package should be listed on a separate line, following the format `package_name==version`.

Remember to update the requirements.txt file whenever you add or remove dependencies in your project to ensure consistent and reproducible installations.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)
