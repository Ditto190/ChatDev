Dear customer,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your issue. I understand that when you run the `main.py` file, it fails to run any of the features of your app design and opens a basic 'Hello World' page with none of the app's features running correctly. I will guide you through the troubleshooting steps to fix this issue.

Based on the provided code, it seems that the `main.py` file is responsible for activating and managing multiple MAS (Multi-Agent System) systems. To resolve the issue, please follow the steps below:

1. Check Dependencies: Ensure that you have installed all the required dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Check File Structure: Make sure that all the required files are present in the correct locations. Verify that the `main.py` file is in the root directory of your project and that all the other files are in their respective locations as mentioned in the code.

3. Check MAS Agents: The `main.py` file scans a predefined directory for MAS agent systems. Please ensure that the MAS agent systems are present in the specified directory. If they are not present, you may need to clone the AutoGen and ChatDev repositories mentioned in the `deployment_guide.py` file.

4. Activate MAS Agents: In the `start()` method of the `ProjectMASUI` class in `main.py`, there are options to list, activate, and deactivate MAS agents. Make sure that you have activated the required MAS agents by selecting the appropriate option.

5. Verify MAS Interaction: The `handle_mas_interaction()` method in the `ReactUI` class of `react_ui.py` file is responsible for interacting with the MAS agents. Ensure that this method is being called correctly and that the expected results are returned.

6. Check for Errors: While running the `main.py` file, check the console or terminal for any error messages or exceptions. These error messages can provide valuable information about the issue and help in troubleshooting.

Please follow these steps and let me know if you encounter any further issues or if you have any additional questions. I'm here to assist you further.
