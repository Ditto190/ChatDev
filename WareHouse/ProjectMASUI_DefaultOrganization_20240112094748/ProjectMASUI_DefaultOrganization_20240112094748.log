As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Enhance the functionality of ProjectMASUI to allow users to select a folder containing MAS agent files, and then develop a feature to automatically load and run the setup for these MAS systems. This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Comments on Codes:
"The code in the main.py file has a duplicate method name "activate_agent". This will cause a NameError when trying to activate an agent. To fix this, one of the methods should be renamed to avoid the conflict."

In the modified code, the duplicate method name "activate_agent" has been renamed to "activate_agent_ui" to avoid the conflict.

You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: Enhance the functionality of ProjectMASUI to allow users to select a folder containing MAS agent files, and then develop a feature to automatically load and run the setup for these MAS systems. This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

| **task_prompt** | Enhance the functionality of ProjectMASUI to allow users to select a folder containing MAS agent files, and then develop a feature to automatically load and run the setup for these MAS systems. This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience. |

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is regarding the missing import statements in the `react_ui.py` file. The `LLMManager`, `GoogleCloud`, `OneDrive`, `AutoGenAPI`, and `ChatDevAPI` classes are referenced but not imported. To fix this, add the necessary import statements at the beginning of the file.

<REVISION>
Add the following import statements at the beginning of the `react_ui.py` file:

```python
from llm_manager import LLMManager
from google_cloud import GoogleCloud
from onedrive import OneDrive
from autogen_api import AutoGenAPI
from chatdev_api import ChatDevAPI

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Enhance the functionality of ProjectMASUI to allow users to select a folder containing MAS agent files, and then develop a feature to automatically load and run the setup for these MAS systems. This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience. |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: Enhance the functionality of ProjectMASUI to allow users to select a folder containing MAS agent files, and then develop a feature to automatically load and run the setup for these MAS systems. This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is regarding the `ProjectMASUI` class in the `main.py` file. The `activate_agent` and `deactivate_agent` methods have the same name as the existing methods in the class, which will cause a conflict. To fix this, you should rename the methods to avoid the conflict.

In the `activate_agent` method, you should also add a check to ensure that the agent is not already active before activating it.

Here's the revised code for the `ProjectMASUI` class:

```python

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The highest priority comment is regarding the `ProjectMASUI` class in the `main.py` file. The `activate_agent` and `deactivate_agent` methods have the same name as the existing methods in the class, which will cause a conflict. To fix this, you should rename the methods to avoid the conflict.

In the `activate_agent` method, you should also add a check to ensure that the agent is not already active before activating it.

Here's the revised code for the `ProjectMASUI` class:

```python
class ProjectMASUI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mas_agents = []
        self.active_agents = []

    def detect_mas_agents(self, directory):
        # Implement functionality to scan a predefined directory for MAS agent systems
        # Identify their main Python scripts, and list them in the UI
        self.mas_agents = []
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
            for file in files:
                if file.endswith(".py"):
                    self.mas_agents.append(os.path.join(root, file))

    def activate_agent(self, agent):
        # Create a section in the UI where users can select and activate these MAS agents
        # This should include starting their respective Python scripts within their environments
        if agent not in self.active_agents:
            process = subprocess.Popen(["python", agent])
            self.active_agents.append((agent, process))
        else:
            print("Agent is already active.")

    def deactivate_agent(self, agent):
        # Deactivate an active MAS agent
        for active_agent in self.active_agents:
            if active_agent[0] == agent:
                active_agent[1].terminate()
                self.active_agents.remove(active_agent)
                break

    def interact_with_agents(self):
        # Develop features for real-time interaction with these MAS agents once they are activated
        # This could include displaying their outputs, status, and any other relevant information in the UI

                    output = process.stdout.readline()
                    if output:
                        # Display agent output in the UI
                        print(f"{agent}: {output.strip()}")
            time.sleep(1)

Please make the necessary changes to the `ProjectMASUI` class as described above."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE

DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: Enhance the functionality of ProjectMASUI to allow users to select a folder containing MAS agent files, and then develop a feature to automatically load and run the setup for these MAS systems. This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of 'changing the digital world through programming'.
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: Enhance the functionality of ProjectMASUI to allow users to select a folder containing MAS agent files, and then develop a feature to automatically load and run the setup for these MAS systems. This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience..
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: Enhance the functionality of ProjectMASUI to allow users to select a folder containing MAS agent files, and then develop a feature to automatically load and run the setup for these MAS systems. This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience.".

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

Your main responsibilities include being an active decision-maker on users' demands and other key policy issues, leader, manager, and executor. Your decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy; and your communicator role can involve speaking to the organization's management and employees.
Here is a new customer's task: Enhance the functionality of ProjectMASUI to allow users to select a folder containing MAS agent files, and then develop a feature to automatically load and run the setup for these MAS systems. This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience..
To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]
