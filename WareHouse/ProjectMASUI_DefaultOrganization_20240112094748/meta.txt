Task:
Enhance the functionality of ProjectMASUI to allow users to select a folder containing MAS agent files, and then develop a feature to automatically load and run the setup for these MAS systems. This process should handle various file types like JSON, Python scripts, and .bat files. After the initial setup of a MAS system, design the app to remember the setup method for future use, streamlining the process for subsequent interactions. This feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing system for cycling through MAS agent files, enhancing the overall user experience.
