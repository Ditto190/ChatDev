# ProjectMASUI User Manual

## Introduction

ProjectMASUI is a web-based Python application that integrates MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with these systems and managing local open-source LLM models. This user manual will guide you through the installation process and explain how to use the software effectively.

## Installation

To install ProjectMASUI, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. Set up a local Django/Flask environment on your desktop. You can choose either Django or Flask based on your preference. To install Django, run the following command:

   ```
   pip install Django==3.2.8
   ```

   To install Flask, run the following command:

   ```
   pip install Flask==2.0.2
   ```

3. Clone the repositories of AutoGen and ChatDev into a structured directory. If you have already cloned them, make sure to select the existing directories during the integration process.

4. Install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the required dependencies, including `google-cloud-storage` and `onedrivesdk`.

## Usage

Once you have installed ProjectMASUI, you can start using it by following these steps:

1. Start the backend development by developing RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev. Focus on sending requests, receiving responses, and handling data parsing and errors. You can refer to the `backend.py` file for the initial structure of the APIs.

2. Create a local open-source LLM management module with basic functions for initializing and loading models. Refer to the `llm_management.py` file for the initial structure of the module.

3. Lay the groundwork for the frontend UI by creating a React-based UI tailored for local desktop usage. Include placeholder sections for MAS interactions and LLM management. You can refer to the `frontend.py` file for the initial structure of the UI.

4. Implement initial modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive to integrate foundational cloud storage functionality. Focus on basic authentication and setup. You can refer to the `cloud_storage.py` file for the initial structure of the modules.

5. Once you have completed the above steps, you will have established the core backend and frontend structure of ProjectMASUI. This will prepare the application for further development of advanced features and components.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully installed and set up ProjectMASUI. This user manual has provided an overview of the installation process and explained how to use the software effectively. You can now start developing the web-based Python application and integrate MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev.
