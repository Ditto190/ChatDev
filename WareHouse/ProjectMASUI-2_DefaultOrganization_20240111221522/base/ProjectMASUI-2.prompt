Begin the development of 'ProjectMASUI', a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev. Start with these foundational steps: 1. Initial Setup and Integration: - Set up a local Django/Flask environment on the desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries. - Integrate AutoGen and ChatDev by cloning their repositories into a structured directory. If already cloned, add functionality to select the existing directories. 2. Backend Development: - Start developing RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, focusing on sending requests and receiving responses, along with initial data parsing and error management. - Begin creating a local open-source LLM management module with basic functions for initializing and loading models. 3. Frontend Development (Initial Phase): - Lay the groundwork for a React-based UI, tailored for local desktop usage. Include placeholder sections for MAS interactions and LLM management. 4. Foundational Cloud Storage Integration: - Implement initial modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive, focusing on basic authentication and setup. This phase should establish the core backend and frontend structure, preparing the application for further development of advanced features and components.
