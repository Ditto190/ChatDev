Task:
Address the initial issue in 'ProjectMASUI' where running 'python main.py' results in only a basic 'Hello World' page. Ensure the main script correctly initializes the full range of web-page functionalities. After resolving this, focus on backend enhancement. Refine the Django/Flask RESTful APIs for complex interactions with various MAS agent systems, including their activation. This should involve advanced data parsing, comprehensive error management, and efficient request-response handling. Develop functionality to detect, list, and manage MAS agents within the application, ensuring these APIs are seamlessly integrated with frontend components and the local LLM management module. This integration should enable users to interact with and control different MAS agents directly from the UI.
