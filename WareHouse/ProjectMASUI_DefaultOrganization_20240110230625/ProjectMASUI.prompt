Develop a web-based Python application with specific features for a local desktop environment. Key components include 1. Initial Setup and Integration: Configure a Django/Flask environment and clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories into a structured directory. Structure this directory to distinguish between the two systems, maintaining their individual file hierarchies and dependencies. If repositories already cloned, provide a way to select the folder/files where the frameworks are situated. 2. Backend Development: Develop RESTful APIs for MAS interaction, a local LLM management module, and cloud storage integration with Google Cloud and OneDrive. 3. Frontend Development: Create a React-based UI with sections for MAS interactions, local LLM management, and a structured data library UI, supporting both local and cloud storage. 4. Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback form in the UI, process feedback in an 'improvement table', and automate feedback to ChatDev. 5. Metrics and Performance Monitoring: Integrate a metrics system and develop an interactive dashboard. 6. Security and Compliance: Implement HTTPS, data encryption, and secure cloud service authentication, ensuring GDPR compliance. 7. Testing and Quality Assurance: Conduct comprehensive testing across all components in a local desktop environment. 8. Documentation and User Support: Provide detailed documentation and establish a user support framework. 9. Deployment and Maintenance: Prepare a local deployment guide and a maintenance plan. This application is designed to integrate with MAS systems like AutoGen and ChatDev, featuring local LLM support, cloud document storage, an interactive feedback system, and robust performance metrics.
