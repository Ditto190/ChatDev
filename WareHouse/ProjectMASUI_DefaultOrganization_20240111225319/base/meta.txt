Task:
Develop a web-based Python application integrating MAS systems AutoGen and ChatDev, designed for local desktop environment. The application should:
1. Set up a Django/Flask environment on the local desktop, including Python, Django/Flask, and necessary libraries.
2. Clone AutoGen and ChatDev repositories into a specific directory, maintaining distinct structures for each system.
3. Develop RESTful APIs in Django/Flask for interacting with AutoGen and ChatDev, including data parsing and error management.
4. Create a module for managing local open-source LLMs, with initialization, loading, and unloading functionalities.
5. Implement modules for Google Cloud and OneDrive integration, including authentication and document upload/download capabilities.
6. Develop a React-based UI for local desktop usage, with distinct sections for MAS interactions, local LLM management, and document handling. Include a data library UI with tabs for code, tables, and figures, and support for local and cloud storage.
7. Implement a feedback mechanism with a UI form, directing feedback to an 'improvement table' and converting feedback into structured prompts for ChatDev.
8. Integrate a metrics system for monitoring application and MAS performance, and develop an interactive dashboard.
9. Ensure robust security protocols including HTTPS, encryption, and secure cloud authentication, and comply with GDPR.
10. Create detailed test plans for all components, emphasizing testing in a local desktop environment.
11. Provide comprehensive documentation and a user support framework.
12. Prepare a local deployment guide and a maintenance plan with regular updates and optimizations.
Include Human-Agent-Interaction mode for interactive code review and modification based on user inputs.
